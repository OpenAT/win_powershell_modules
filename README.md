# win_powershell_modules

this repo keeps the dadi win powershell modules

to create a new one you just need to copy the appropriate template into the main directory of this repo

VB:
after copying the vb template you just need to rename all files and all dirs. this can easy be done with the powershell cmdlet Rename-Project (part of the PSRefactoring module).
